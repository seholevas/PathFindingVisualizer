Problems:
grid.js: had a problem iterating through the 2d array properly with the map function.
2d arrays: cannot simply create a shallow copy with [...array]
shallow copies with objects

controls.js: if the select-box has a "selected default" that is "disabled" the start_coordinates will be = [], which will throw an error.

this is from gh-pages branch readme file!
